        <h2 id="install">Install a plugin</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Fetch the plugin. If it is inside a (comcodessed) package,
                    unpack it to get to the .py file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Copy the .py file to the appropriate directory. There are three options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you installed P1tr by unpacking the tarball or fetching it via
                            <a href="http://bazaar.vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>, copy the .py file to
                            the "plugins" folder inside the P1tr directory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If P1tr was copied to your home directory on your first run, the "plugins"
                            folder is situated in <code>~/.p1tr</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you installed P1tr using the Debian package you can copy the .py file
                            to /usr/share/p1tr, if you have root rights.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    When P1tr is running, you can load a newly added or removed plugin with the
                    <code>reload</code> command. <code>restart</code> is also recommended. You must use it
                    to reload a plugin, which hasn't been added, but modified. Both commands require
                    level 30.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the <code>help</code> command to find out what the plugin can do:<br />
                    <code>help pluginname</code><br />
                    ...where pluginname equals the filename of the .py file.
                </li>
                <li>Have fun!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 id="writing">Write your own plugin</h2>
        <p>
            P1tr almost entirely consists of plugins. And none of the included ones is really required
            to run P1tr (whereas it is recommended to keep at least auth, basics, and topic) - you can
            deactivate them all. As well you can add as many plugins as you want, and write your own
            ones. The last thing is done codetty simple. All you need is, depending on how sophisticated
            your plugin will be, some Python skill.
        </p>
        <h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h3>
        <p>
            First of all, create a blank file called yourpluginname.py inside your P1tr installation's
            plugin directory. It is highly recommended to name your plugin with a single lowercase word 
            without any non-latin characters, and keep special characters (.,!#+-_/) out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a working plugin this file must at least contain the following lines of code:<br />
<PRE>
<B><FONT COLOR="#A020F0">from</FONT></B> lib.plugin <B><FONT COLOR="#A020F0">import</FONT></B> Plugin

<B><FONT COLOR="#A020F0">class</FONT></B> SamplePlugin(Plugin):
    
    
    <B><FONT COLOR="#A020F0">def</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">__init__</FONT></B>(self):
        Plugin.__init__(self, <B><FONT COLOR="#BC8F8F">'sample'</FONT></B>)</PRE>
            It lies in plugins/sample.py and does nothing but existing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In technical terms, each plugin is derived from the Plugin class in the lib.plugin package.
            Therefore all those useful functions in this class are available to a plugin, and there 
            is a lot of them. Their documentation can be found <a href="http://server.austriangeekforce.net/p1tr/doc/api/p1tr.lib.plugin.Plugin.html">here</a>.<br />
            The following functions are called whenever the respective event occurs, so you can write
            code which is executed whenever a user leaves with the <code>user_joined</code> function:
            <code>user_joined, user_kicked, user_action, topic_updated, user_renamed, received_MOTD,
            user_quit, user_part, mode_changed, bot_kicked, bot_joined, bot_part</code><br />
            Simply overwrite them with the code you want. A demonstration of how this works will be
            shown later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we want to add a command which returns a string given by the command invoker and calls
            his nickname when doing so. The invoker should have to do this, when P1tr is the bot's name:
            <br /><br /><code>P1tr: string This is some text to return.</code><br /><br />
            As you probably know it is possible (and usual) to use the signal character you specified
            in the configuration file instead of the bot's name, which looks like this in the same case
            as above, if ! is your signal character:
            <br /><br /><code>!string This is some text to return.</code><br /><br />
            The result we want to have is that the bot writes a message like this, where invoker is
            the nick of the person who invokes the command:
            <br /><br /><code>invoker, you wrote "This is some text to return."</code><br />
        </p>
        <p>
            To achieve this this the code in plugins/simple.py has to look like this:<br />

            Actually, the stuff in the lines of 1, 3, 7, and 8 are dispensable. Nevertheless I mention
            it here because it is important.<br />
            <strong>Explanations:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    This function sets a help message which explains the purpose of the plugin. It is 
                    being displayed when calling the command <code>help sample</code>, where sample is
                    the name of the plugin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first argument is the name of the command. The second contains a list of possible
                    parameters (will be displayed in the command's help message). If there are none, use
                    None instead of a string. The third argument is a help string which can be viewed
                    using the command <code>help sample command</code>, where command is the name of the
                    command.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can also add help topics without creating a command. In our sample case the
                    content of the second argument is being shown when the <code>help sample holy_handgranade</code>
                    is being called.<br />If a help string is too long for one line use a backslash ("\")
                    and continue in the next line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>string</code> function is being called when a user invokes the string
                    command. A command's function must always have the name specified in the first
                    argument of the respective <code>self._add_command</code> function.<br />
                    Minimally such a function needs <code>self</code> as argument, but if you want to
                    process information the invoker gave you with his invoking message you can add
                    <code>msg</code> of which we will talk in the following few points.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>msg</code> contains all available information about the message which invoked
                    the command. In this like we see how the invoker's nickname is being extracted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>msg.params</code> contains the parameters of a message as a single string,
                    which means everything but the signal character/the bot's name and the command. In
                    our example, when calling the command <code>!string This is some text to return.</code>,
                    <code>msg.params</code> contains "This is some text to return.".
                </li>
                <li>
                    The complete message including everything, even the command's name, exists as a
                    single string in <code>msg.msg</code>.
                </li>
                <li>Get the name of the current channel via <code>msg.chan</code></li>
                <li>
                    Give <code>return</code> a string and the bot will print is as a response in the
                    channel where the command was invoked.<br />
                    Another way of writing things to a channel is <code>msg.bot.msg(channel, message)</code>,
                    where you have to give the target channel and a message as arguments.<br />
                    By the way, <code>msg.bot</code> gives access to all functions in <a href="http://server.austriangeekforce.net/p1tr/doc/api/p1tr.lib.core.IRCBot.html">here</a>
                    and everything the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRCClient.html">IRCClient</a>
                    class of twisted words has to offer.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note!</strong> P1tr plugins are just normal Python code. Therefore mind the
            indentations and the case.
        </p>
        <h3 id="gettingon">Getting on</h3>
        <p>
            The probably best way of learning how to write P1tr plugins is reading existing ones.
            Especially the following are well suitable for learning: textutils (basic plugin structure),
            talkback (listener), unix (using output from software on the system), memo (resources) - 
            in order of difficulty.
