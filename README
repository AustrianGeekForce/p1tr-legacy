 *** P1tr IRC Bot 0.1alpha *******************
 *** by AustrianGeekForce and contributors ***

 === INTRODUCTION === 
P1tr is a solid IRC bot written in Python. For establishing a connection it
uses Twisted Words by Twisted Laboratories. Later P1tr will be capable of
connecting to all protocols available in Twisted Words.
Furthermore P1tr provides a powerful plug-in infrastructure which leaves no
wish open (if it does, notify us, please).

 === REQUIREMENTS === 
Following stuff is required to run P1tr successfully:
    * Python >= 2.4
    * Twisted >= 2.0
    * Bazaar VCS (optional; to get the latest sources from trunk)
P1tr has been successfully tested on the following operating systems:
    * Gentoo
    * Mac OS X 10.5.x
    * Ubuntu 7.10, 8.04
    * Windows XP SP2

 === INSTALL === 
In case you want to install a halfway stable version:
    * Download http://server.austriangeekforce.net/p1tr/p1tr_0.1alpha.tar.gz
    * Unpack this file in a folder of your choice
    * Satisfy the requirements if you haven't already done so
    * Create a copy of file bot.conf.ex called bot.conf and edit it 
      to suit your needs

 === LAUNCH === 
Launch P1tr from the command line inside the P1tr directory with:
$ python bot.py
To make bot.py clickable or to make it launch via $ ./bot.py you may have
to make the file executable before:
$ chmod +x bot.py

 === PLUGINS === 
At launchtime all files inside plugins/ are being loaded as plug-ins. To find
out how they work you may have a look at plugins/length.py and
plugins/talkback.py. They are heavily commented and give a good impression how
that stuff works. One plug-in can provide an unlimited number of keywords as
long they don't conflict with the ones of other plug-ins.

 === FAQs === 
    * IS P1TR CAPABLE OF CONNECTING TO MULTIPLE SERVERS?
      Yes, it is. In later versions we also plan connectivity to several
      protocols like Jabber, OSCAR, and MSN.
    * I MISS A FEATURE; WHAT CAN I DO?
      If you are lazy you can ask us to do the work for you. We won't
      discriminate you for that, but we would be even happier if you would
      send a patch to us which adds the missing feature. If it really does the
      trick it will be included in the distribution and of course your name
      appears in big shiny fixed-width letters in the README file.
      For feature proposals you can use the blueprint function of launchpad.net
      (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/p1tr) or just use one of the ways of
      communication mentioned down there.
    * WHAT AM I ALLOWED TO DO WITH P1TR AND IT'S SOURCE?
      Thou shalt not skip reading LICENSE.
      This project is licensed under the revised BSD-license. You can do with
      P1tr whatever you want as long as you add a notice to the product you
      make out of it, which says that the product contains code from P1tr. How
      this notice has to look exactly can be looked up in LICENSE.
    * P1TR HARMED ANIMALS, KILLED MY FAMILY, BURNED MY HOUSE, KEPT KING ARTHUR
      FROM SEIZING THE HOLY GRAIL AND HE ERASED EMACS FROM MY HARDDRIVE. YOU
      ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT!
      No, we are not. Read LICENSE. P1tr is delivered without warranty of
      function and anything else.
    * WHY IS IT CALLED P1TR (AND NOT PETER or PITR)?
      First, P1tr has a certain idol whose name is copyrighted, so we changed
      the name to avoid copyright infringement. Second, all bots which live on
      our server have a '1' in their name.
